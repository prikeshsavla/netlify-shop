We stripped our G400s gaming mouse to its core and made it better, stronger and faster. Hyperion Fury’s Fusion Engine offers tracking speeds so fast that your opponents won’t know what hit them. Eight programmable buttons and four DPI settings put pinpoint targeting and easy hotkey access at your fingertips. In combination with our Delta Zero sensor, Hyperion Fury gives you the speed and accuracy you need to blow away the competition.



#### High-speed Fusion Engine

The exclusive Fusion Engine and Delta Zero sensor give you the power to track reliably and accurately at speeds as fast as 10 metres per second (420 IPS). And with a 1-millisecond report rate, your moves are executed at the fastest speed possible over USB.



#### Eight programmable buttons with on-board memory

Customise your gaming experience with programmable buttons you can save to Hyperion Fury’s on-board memory for maximum speed and accessibility. Chat with a teammate, execute a multi-command macro or downshift DPI with fast one-press triggers. Optional Logitech Gaming Software makes setting up commands easy.



#### Four on-the-fly DPI settings

Instantly downshift for pixel-perfect sniping or shift up for high-speed manoeuvres—all with maximum precision. Go from 4000 to 250 DPI in the blink of an eye, giving you the flexibility to thrive in the chaos of battle. Use Logitech Gaming Software to set a fifth DPI setting and personalise the experience to your liking.



#### 32-bit ARM Processor

Hyperion Fury’s on-board ARM Processor powers the Fusion Engine for incredible tracking speeds. It also works with Logitech Gaming Software to let you craft and assign macros that you can access with ease.



#### Designed for gaming comfort

We updated the classic G400s shape to a new level of streamlined comfort. Lightweight materials and super-low friction feet ensure that your gaming sessions last as long as you can.
